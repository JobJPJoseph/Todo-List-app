### Item
    Constructor
        We need to have 3 properties: title, deadline and description. With deadline, we need to test if the
        deadline is in the valid format. Note: We can't call instance methods before initialization but class instances we can.

    validDate
        The purpose of this method is to test if the deadline is in a proper format. Meaning we need to test the length, make sure it includes two dashes and includes nothing but numbers.
            Based on the old code, there is a time complexity issue.
